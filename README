These are the bash_rc files I use for Linux and mac.  For Linux I have mainly
tested on CentOS and Ubuntu

A lot of this is hacked together over the years, but it's solid and it works.

Takes care of a few obvious things, such as:
* Directory / links coloring
* Prompt with domain in it
* Auto-correcting common command misspellings
* A few obvious PATH variables, such as mysql

The mac one is only slightly different, I keep them separate only because
I don't want a lot of conditionals switching between mac / linux.
