Storing my bashrc here since I kept getting annoyed at having to mess
with it with every machine i'm on.  Others are welcome to enjoy.

Mainly this is forked from a cool bashrc my friend had then hacked
together over the years, but i'm hoping that storing it on github
and having a spot where I can always pull it from will create some
sanity in the process.

There's a standing issue where there's a problem with multi-line
input, still working on that.
